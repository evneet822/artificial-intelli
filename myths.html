          <p>
            In computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence,
            is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans.
            Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents":
            any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully
            achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines
            (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning"
            and "problem solving".
          </p>

          <p>
            As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the
            definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. A quip in Tesler's Theorem says "AI is whatever hasn't
            been done yet." For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered
            to be AI , having become a routine technology. Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI
            include successfully understanding human speech,competing at the highest level in strategic game systems
            (such as chess and Go),autonomously operating cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, and
            military simulations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955, and in the years since has experienced
            several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"),
            followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. For most of its history, AI research
            has been divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other.These sub-fields are based
            on technical considerations, such as particular goals (e.g. "robotics" or "machine learning"), the use of
            particular tools ("logic" or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences.
            Subfields have also been based on social factors (particular institutions or the work of particular researchers).
